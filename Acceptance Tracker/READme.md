# **Not Currently working in Terminal. Must use pycharm. Works fine on the local mac where the files are but when I tried to clone the files on my pc none on the imports worked. Including library.py

# Acceptance Tracker



## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have installed the required Python modules.

### Required Modules:

- `colorama`: For colorful terminal output
- `pwinput`: For securely handling password input

To install these dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install colorama pwinput
```

## Usage

The application uses a default username and password:

- **Username**: `USER`
- **Password**: `PASSWORD`

After entering the correct credentials, you will be able to use the application to track acceptances.
Once successful authentication with the default credentials, the user will be able to change the pass word to their own.

### Inside the application you can:
1. View your statuses for applications (once set)
2. Change application statuses
3. Stay secure with a username and password

## Installation and Running the Program

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the required modules (as mentioned above).
3. Open the cloned directory in terminal.
4. Run the Python script.

```bash
python main.py
```



## About

This project was created on a sick day at school. It may not be fully optimized, but itâ€™s a good starting point for tracking acceptances.
